# Devlin Bridges

## Welcome to my repository!

Hey y'all, this is Devlin's repository for **UVA's MSDS program** and learning to navigate Github better. It's also some practice in using *markdown*.
As of right now, the only contributor to this little project is:
- Me

If you want to get to know me a little better, here are some fun facts about me:
- I was born in Milan, Italy on July 4th, 1994
- I lived in five different countries before going to college
- I majored in math at the University of Georgia (Go Dawgs)
- I got my start in data analysis doing a small project on the best and worst constructed teams in the NBA by examining contracts against the VORP of players and seeing if teams were overpaying, underpaying, or just correctly paying for their on-court product (obviously there's a lot more than goes into roster construction but it was my first time so I'm cutting myself a break ((Go Wizards)) (((I will never see them make the ECF in my lifetime))))

I'm excited to learn more about using Github and customizing my README MySpace style.

To get a hang of how READMEs are set up, what should be included in them, and how markdown works, I used these three *immensely* helpful sources: [1](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes), [2](https://commonmark.org/help/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/jzh96b/how_to_build_creative_readme_for_your_github/).

Thanks for reading!
